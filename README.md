## Authentication in Desktop App

User authentication in a desktop application is more complex than standard in-browser authentication. The flow below is based on [this guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/security/iam#integrating-internet-identity-on-mobile-devices), which describes a delegation-based approach for mobile and desktop integration using Internet Identity.

This implementation follows a more secure delegation pattern as recommended in [Recommendation 6](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/security/iam#recommendation-6), where an intermediate identity is created during the authentication process via the web version (shown as a "secure proxy app" in the diagram below).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as User
    participant DA as Desktop App
    participant WA as Web App
    participant II as Internet Identity
    participant BE as Backend
    autonumber
    note over U,DA: User clicks "Sign in"
    U ->> DA: Sign in
    DA ->> DA: Generate session key pair
    DA ->> WA: Open in browser <br/>`/delegation?sessionPublicKey=<br/>$sessionPublicKey`
    WA ->> WA: Generate intermediate session key
    Note over WA: This key never leaves<br/> the Web App front-end
    WA ->> II: Standard II client auth protocol<br/>using intermediate session key
    Note over WA,II: II will create a delegation for the<br/>intermediate key and not for the attacker<br/>chosen session key.
    U ->> II: Authenticate with passkey
    II -->> WA: Return the delegation<br/>using the postMessage API
    WA ->> WA: Construct the delegation chain
    Note over WA: The Web App front-end creates a<br/>delegation from the intermediate<br/> key to the desktop app session key<br/>and combines it with the<br/>delegation from the II canister key<br/>to the intermediate key.
    WA -->> DA: Return the delegation chain
    Note over WA,DA: Return the delegation chain to <br/>the desktop app using deep-link
    DA ->> DA: Verify the delegation chain<br/>against the session<br/>key from step 2
    U ->> DA: Authenticated call
    DA ->> BE: Update call using the verified delegation chain
    BE -->> DA: <<Response>>
```

## Local Development

To run this project locally, you'll need the following tools installed:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Start the project with:

```bash
docker compose up
```

During initialization, the script installs all dependencies, builds the Internet Identity, backend, and frontend canisters. A [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)-powered local HTTPS server is used. You'll need to generate and trust a local root certificate.

On macOS, run the following to install the [Caddy CA](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#local-https) certificate:

```bash
npm run install:ca
```

Once running, Internet Identity will be available at:
**`https://rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai.localhost/`**
Other canisters will be available at `https://<canister-id>.localhost`.

## Development Modes

In addition to the standard `development` and `production` modes, the project includes a third mode: `staging`. Hereâ€™s an overview:

### Development

To run the standard web version in development:

```bash
npm run start
```

To run the desktop version in development (Tauri):

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

This uses browser-based authentication via a frontend proxy and deep linking to return control to the desktop app. Note that macOS (and iOS/Android) does not support runtime deep link registration, which may complicate testing authentication. On Windows/Linux, this should work as expected.

### Staging

Think of this as your applicationâ€™s `testnet`. Every time you want to preview changes, you deploy to staging. Angular uses `src/environments/environment.staging.ts` for build-time config.

Update the frontend canister build script in [`dfx.json`](https://github.com/faragly/ic-2fa-auth/blob/main/dfx.json#L14):

```diff
"ic-2fa-auth-frontend": {
  "dependencies": ["ic-2fa-auth-backend"],
  "source": ["dist/ic-2fa-auth/browser"],
  "type": "assets",
- "build": ["npm run build"]
+ "build": ["npm run build:staging"]
},
```

Then deploy:

```bash
docker compose exec backend dfx deploy ic-2fa-auth-frontend
```

To build the Tauri desktop app in staging mode:

```bash
npm run tauri:build:staging
```

To enable [WebView Console](https://v2.tauri.app/develop/debug/#webview-console), modify [`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`](https://github.com/faragly/ic-2fa-auth/blob/main/src-tauri/Cargo.toml#L18):

```diff
[dependencies]
-tauri = { version = "2.2.5", features = [] }
+tauri = { version = "2.2.5", features = ["devtools"] }
```

Or install the [CrabNebula DevTools](https://v2.tauri.app/develop/debug/crabnebula-devtools/) plugin.

## Cleanup

After you're done, shut down the development environment:

```bash
docker compose down
```
